    <h1>When to use the Subjunctive in Spanish </h1>
    <p> I got my Bachelors Degree in Modern Spanish Language and honestly, I still get a little confuzed sometimes on when to use subjunctive and when not to. I've noticed the use of subjunctive regularly when speaking to native speakers but when I ask people about it they are often as confused as I am. It seems to be something that is just common sense or coloquial when to and when not use the illusive subjunctive congegations.</p>
    <p> This is my attempt to break it down when to and how to use the subjunctive</p>

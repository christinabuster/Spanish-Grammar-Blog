    <h1>When to use the Subjunctive in Spanish </h1>
    <p> I got my Bachelors Degree in Modern Spanish Language and honestly, I still get a little confuzed on when to use subjunctive and when not to sometimes. If you have experienced this, <strong> you are not alone!</strong> It's one thing to memorize how to conjugate these little devil's, it's another to <strong> know exactly how and when to apply them</strong> in everyday conversations without the obvious pause "is now a good time to throw that in".
    <p>I've noticed the use of subjunctive used regularly when talking with native speakers but when I ask people about when and why they are using it they too are often as confused as I am. It seems to be something that is just common sense or coloquial to those in the native toung when to use the illusive subjunctive conjegations. The same goes for those native English speaker, myself included!</p>
    <h2> This is my attempt to break it down when to and how to use the subjunctive</h2>
    <p> First it is important to know that <strong> Subjunctive is not a tense, it's a mood.</strong> Reflecting how the speaker feels about an action, this is how we decide to conjugate the verb. By first distinguishing whether it is subjunctive or indicative then by determining what tense we are speaking in.</p>
    <h3> Recognizing the Subjunctive Triggers </h2>
    <p> One of the most common triggers of <strong> the subjunctive is the expression of doubt.</strong></p>
